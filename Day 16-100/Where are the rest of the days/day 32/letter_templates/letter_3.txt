Dear Ishita,

Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‰

On this special day, I just wanted to remind you how much you mean to me. Your constant support, endless encouragement, and the way you always know how to cheer me up â€” it all means the world. You've stood by me through everything, and I honestly don't know what Iâ€™d do without you.

I hope this year brings you as much joy, peace, and success as you bring to everyone around you. Never stop being the amazing, strong, and kind-hearted person you are.

Have a beautiful birthday filled with laughter and love!

With lots of love,
Bhavishya ðŸ’›
